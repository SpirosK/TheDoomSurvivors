# The Doom Survivors
## By SpirosK of the Retro Games Couple

This was based on a Godot Tutorial and it is actually my first game in Godot.
Sorry for not being able to include the PNGs, SFX and Music, but they are copyrighted assets of Bethesda.

I am aware the code is not very good, but it served its purpose of teaching my what I needed to learn
and I won't spend more time than necessary on something that I cannot publish.

On the bright side, I have added as many comments as I could think that might be useful
to someone that learns Godot for the first time, like me!
